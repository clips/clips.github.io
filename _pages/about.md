The Computational Linguistics group within [CLiPS](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/clips/)  has a long history in the application of Machine Learning methods in Natural Language Processing. We focus on basic and strategic research on the automatic extraction of knowledge from unstructured language data (text and speech): factual knowledge (information and ontology extraction), subjective knowledge (sentiment and emotion mining), and meta-knowledge (author profiling). In addition, we are active in research on computational stylometry and text generation. We use a broad range of ML methods including deep learning and develop open source tools for the research community.  CLiPS is headed by [prof. dr. Walter Daelemans](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/~walter/).
