The [CLiPS](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/clips/) (Computational Linguistics & Psycholinguistics) research center is associated with the Linguistics department of the faculty of Arts of the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/).

CLiPS aims at performing research in and producing resources for (developmental) psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and computational linguistics, and to investigate the interdisciplinary combinations of these disciplines. We provide a unique combination of methodologies in our study of language: empirical psycholinguistic methods, corpus linguistics, and computational modeling.
