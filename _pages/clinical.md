Introduce Clips' part in Accumulate:
WP2:Terminology extraction, alignment, named entity recognition and coding
This WP develops the necessary preparatory steps for successful medical event and relation extraction. The main focus of this work package is on extraction, normalization and semantic classification of single and multi-term units in English and Dutch patient records. The scientific challenge is mastering the domain-specific (sometimes physician-specific) terminology and map it to terminological standards.

WP3: Medical event extraction
This WP focuses on the recognition of medical events and their attributes including the processing of extra-propositional aspects of meaning such as negation, modality and quantification.
