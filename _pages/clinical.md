[CLiPS](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/clips/) has had multiple successful projects in Clinical NLP, described below.

# <a name="Accumulate"/>Accumulate

Accumulate (Acquiring Crucial Medical information Using Language Technology) is a large SBO-IWT funded program focusing on developing fundamental technology for the processing of clinical language in English and Dutch. The [project](http://www.accumulate.be/) is a cooperation  with the University of Leuven and the university hospitals of Antwerp and Leuven. At CLiPS we have intensively worked on the following:

- spelling normalization,
- concept and relation extraction,
- negation and speculation detection,
- patient representation learning,
- question answering,
- interpretability,
- ethics and
- clinical prediction tasks.

# <a name="Previous"/>Previous projects

The computational linguistics group of the CLiPS (CLiPS-CLG)  research centre has a long history in biomedical Natural Language Processing, starting with the multidisciplinary EU FP6 project [BIOMINT](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/projects/biomint-biological-text-mining) (Biological Text Mining, 2003-2006), where we developed Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools for knowledge extraction on medical text in cooperation with the Universities of Leuven, Geneva (SIB), Manchester, and Vienna. We continued this line of research with the BOF GOA project [Biograph](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/BiographTA/) (Text Mining with Heterogeneous Knowledge Bases, 2007-2011), coordinated by CLiPS, where graph-based data mining techniques were applied to a combination of structured background knowledge (ontologies) and relations between concepts extracted from biomedical text (Medline). In that project, we successfully cooperated with the data mining and molecular genetics departments of the University of Antwerp and focused on deep analysis of biomedical text (e.g. looking at markers of uncertainty like negation and modality). We have also recently finished an **IWT PhD** project on clinical coding (Elyne Scheurwegs: Data fusion and structured input and output Machine Learning techniques for automated clinical coding, 2014-2017) in cooperation with the data mining research of the computer science department and the Antwerp University Hospital. CLiPS has also participated in a VLAIO Baekeland PhD project with the company Lynxcare as a partner.

In addition, our group has also been active in international benchmarking competitions on biomedical and clinical NLP, both from the side of their organisation (for example the CLEF 2012 and 2013 Labs on Question Answering for Machine Reading of biomedical texts about Alzheimer disease, Rome and Valencia) as from the side of participation, for example CEGS N-GRID shared task 2016 about psychiatric symptom severity identification and the 2018 n2c2 shared task on cohort selection.
