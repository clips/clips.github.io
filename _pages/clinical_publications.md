The papers published in the Accumulate project span the topics of:
- normalization,
- concept and relation extraction,
- document representation learning,
- question answering,
- interpretability,
- ethics and
- clinical prediction tasks.

In addition to English, we have also worked with Dutch when the data was available. We also wrote several technical reports about annotation, which are not listed here (please get in touch with us for more information).
