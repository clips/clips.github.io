LiLaH (The Linguistic Landscape of Hate Speech in Social Media) is an FWO (Flemish NSF) funded project focusing on 
building systems that can automatically recognize and analyse hate speech in social media text. The analysis will be on different linguistic levels and different levels of complexity.

We are interested in the language that is being used to express hate in social media, specifically hate against migrants and LGBT people, and in automatically detecting it.  The languages addressed are English and Dutch

The project is a cooperation between [CLiPS](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/clips/), [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/) and [the Department of Translation] (https://prevajalstvo.ff.uni-lj.si/en/) ([University of Ljubljana] (https://www.uni-lj.si/eng/about_university_of_ljubljana.aspx), Slovenia) and the Department of Knowledge Technologies (Jozef Stefan Institute, Slovenia).
